# Project: Analyzing Police Killings

In this project, we'll be working with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data on police killings. Due in part to recent high-profile shootings of civilians by police in the US, the media and public have been scrutinizing police killings heavily. If you browse social media and news sites, you may get the sense that there's been a large uptick in civilian shootings by police in the US. We'll investigate the data. 

The team at FiveThirtyEight has data on [the subject](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-killings). 

## Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `police_killings_exploration.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Analyzing Movie Reviews/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
jupyter notebook police_killings_exploration.ipynb
```

or
```
ipython notebook police_killings_exploration.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is included as `police_killings.csv`. This dataset is provided by FiveThirtyEight.
